# Tailwind CSS @apply Directive Issue with Conditionally Rendered Components

This repository demonstrates a bug where Tailwind CSS's `@apply` directive doesn't apply styles correctly when used within conditionally rendered components.  The issue is more prominent in frameworks like Next.js or Nuxt.js that employ server-side rendering or similar mechanisms.

## Bug Description
The `@apply` directive, a powerful Tailwind feature, fails to apply its associated styles when the component containing it is initially not rendered. Only after the component mounts (becomes visible) are styles correctly applied. This inconsistency leads to visual discrepancies and unexpected behavior.

## Reproduction
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Run the application using `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`.
4. Observe the initial rendering of the component and how the styles only appear after a re-render (e.g. changing a prop or re-mounting).

## Solution
The solution involves ensuring that the CSS containing the `@apply` directives is always processed by Tailwind, regardless of conditional rendering.  This can be achieved by restructuring the component or using techniques to force a full re-render/style update when the conditions change.   See `conditional-rendering-solution.js` for the corrected implementation.
