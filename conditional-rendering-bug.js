This bug occurs when using Tailwind CSS with a framework like Next.js or Nuxt.js.  The issue arises when Tailwind's `@apply` directive is used within a component's scoped styles, but the component is rendered conditionally (e.g., based on props or state).  If the component isn't rendered initially, the `@apply` directives might not be applied correctly, leading to unexpected styling issues.  This often manifests as missing styles or elements not having the expected classes applied to them.
